          <h2>The race is on</h2>
          <p>
            We're still reeling from the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, partner, and neighbor who was shot and killed by an ICE
            agent in South Minneapolis last week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her life mattered - and her family, friends, and everyone in our community and beyond who are grieving are in our thoughts. The fear, anger, and
            pain in Minneapolis right now are very real and ongoing.
          </p>
          <p>To state it plainly:</p>
          <p>
            Fuck ICE - an institution whose actions have brought violence, fear, and harm into our streets. We, at Stupor Bowl, stand behind that statement and
            have a firm, unwavering stance against hate in all its forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're still struggling to find our words. It does feel wrong in a time of crisis to be planning a bike event when everything around you feels like
            it's on fire. But Stupor Bowl was built on the foundations of community first - always. As a community, we know bikes can be healing and a source of
            solidarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are continuing to plan Stupor Bowl - scheduled for Saturday, February 7th 2026 - with the intention that this event remains a space for
            connection, care, and resilience at a moment when Minneapolis needs it most. In the days and weeks ahead we will do our best to share updates about
            the event and our sponsors in a thoughtful way.
          </p>
          <p>They want us to hide. we refuse. These are our streets. Fuck ICE.</p>
