            <h1>About Stupor Bowl</h1>
            <p>The "Stupor Bowl" in Minneapolis is a unique and somewhat notorious annual bike race that embodies a blend of athletic challenge and social revelry. It's an event that has become a staple of the city's cycling culture, particularly within the bike messenger community. Held on the Saturday before the Super Bowl, it draws participants from across the city and beyond.</p>

            <p>At its core, the Stupor Bowl is an "alleycat" race, meaning it involves cyclists navigating a series of checkpoints scattered throughout Minneapolis. However, it distinguishes itself with its strong association with social gatherings, often centered around bars and other local establishments. This duality creates a dynamic where riders can choose to prioritize speed and competition or embrace the more relaxed, social aspect of the event.</p>

            <p>The race's history has evolved, with the inclusion of drinking at checkpoints adding a distinctive element. This has contributed to the event's reputation for a somewhat chaotic and festive atmosphere. Participants often face the challenge of balancing physical exertion with the effects of consuming beverages at various stops.</p>

            <p>The Stupor Bowl's structure resembles a scavenger hunt, as riders are given a manifest of checkpoints and allowed to determine their own routes. This adds a strategic layer to the race, as participants must consider factors like distance, traffic, and their own physical condition.</p>

            <p>Despite its association with social drinking, the Stupor Bowl also attracts serious cyclists who compete for speed and bragging rights. The event showcases a diverse range of participants, from seasoned bike messengers to recreational riders, all drawn to the unique blend of competition and camaraderie.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the Stupor Bowl is more than just a bike race; it's a cultural phenomenon that reflects the spirit of Minneapolis's cycling community. It's an event that embraces both the thrill of competition and the joy of social connection, creating a memorable experience for all who participate.</p>
